Living without electricity in today's fast-paced and technology-dependent
environment would pose significant challenges for individuals and society. A
significant portion of the population unintentionally utilizes electric energy
inefficiently, often without realizing they are contributing to wastage. In this
project try to reduce electricity wastage involves adopting energy-efficient
practices and technologies to optimize energy using Machine Learning
Techniques. With the proliferation of smart metering technologies, accurate
electricity consumption prediction at the individual household level is becoming
essential for effective energy management. Despite the increasing deployment of
smart meters, obtaining such data directly from measurements can still be
challenging, particularly when attempting to gather historical data over a
reasonable period for many end users. In this project we use machine learning
algorithms such Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Decision Tree Regression
(DTR).Various assessment measures, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2) were used to assess the performance of the models.
